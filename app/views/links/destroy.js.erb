// This doesn't quite work as if you delete a link in the middle of the list, the others don't move
// Also the placeholder doesn't move across, but slides into its original place and then jumps
// $("#droppable-li").show("slide", { direction: "right" }, 1000);
$('#link_<%= @link.id %>').hide("drop", { direction: "down" }, 1000);
